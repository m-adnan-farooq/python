    "\n",
    "##### Python method is called on an object, unlike a function. Since we call a method on an object, it can access the data within it. A method may alter an object's state, but Python function usually only operates on it, and then prints something or returns a value."

    "###### An object is an instantiation of a class.  An object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified. For example, a student, a desk, a circle, a button, and even a loan can all be viewed as objects. An object has a unique identity, state, and behavior.\n",
